## Code

### Overview

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for details about the project structure and important files.

### Writing Text for Internationalization

Before adding any static text to the web client, please internationalize it, so it can be translated! See our [internationalization guide](INTERNATIONALIZATION.md).

Example:

```jsx
return <h1>{t("welcomeMessage")}</h1>
```

### Test Suites

When adding new functionality or fixing bugs, please consider including tests. Unit, component, and end-to-end tests are configured for this project.

### Third-Party Libraries

Before adding a library to the project, verify its licensing and ensure the project is actively maintained.
