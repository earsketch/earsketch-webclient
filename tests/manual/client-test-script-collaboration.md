# Tests

Open 2 different browsers, login as different users

1. Add/Remove Collaborators

- Add a single collaborator and verify that the user bubbles are active when the script is open. Verify the collaborator recieves a notification. 
- Remove the collaborator. Verify the user bubbles once more, and make sure the collaborator can no longer see the script in the shared script menu.
- Add 2 or more collaborators. Follow the same procedure and verify the same results as with 1 collaborator. 
- Remove the same 2 or more collaborators. Again follow and verify the same steps. 
- Remove every collaborator and verify that all user bubbles disappear.
- Note if any step needed a refresh before working properly.

2. Cursor Position

- Move the cursor with the arrow keys
- Move the cursor by clicking in an area with the mouse
- Drag/Highlight a section of text
- Select all of a given region (double/triple click)
- Select a word (CTRL/CMD + shift + left/right)
- Select all text in the editor (CTRL/CMD + A)
- Observe cursor while typing
- Observe cursor while deleting with backspace
- Set cursor to the ends of line (CTRL/CMD + left/right)
- Set cursor to the ends of the text editor (CTRL/CMD + up/down)

3. Editing

- Add text from one user, and then the other. Confirm changes are accuractly reflected, and see if the cursor behaves differently than the last test. 
- Try to type extremely fast. See how this is represented
- Attempt to have multiple editors type at once.

4. Conflicts

- Try to edit the same region at the same time as the other browser. See that the conflicts are presented consistently over time. Check both edits to the same line and same position within a line. 

5. Collaborator Bubbles/Status

- Check the status of the bubbles indicating users on the script. Have both users check when originally added, refreshing, signing in, closing and reopening the script, etc. 

6. Log In/Log Out

- Try logging out from both users. Make sure status is represented correctly in the bubbles. Also make sure the shared script is not available once logged out.
- Having logged out with the session running, try to log back in. 

7. Manual Save

- Save script versions by keystroke (CMD/CTRL + S) or compiling as the owner. As the owner, see if you can revert the script to a previous version. As another user, make sure you cannot do this.

8. Extended Time

- Stay in the collaborative session for about 5 minutes. Make sure collaborative editing continues to work, and note if any "synchronization errors" appear.

9. General Notifications

- Note the behaviors of notifications throughout the process. Document if any are inconsistent, do not appear, or do not appear as intented. 

10. Rename

- Rename the script as the owner. Verify the change is present for collaborators, and note if a refresh is needed. 

11. Delete

- As a collaborator, delete the script from the shared scripts menu. Verify that the script is removed then and after a refresh (or a new sign in), and verify the user bubbles are updated.
- As the owner, delete the script. Verify that any sessions with collaborators have ended, and make sure the script is gone from the script browser.
