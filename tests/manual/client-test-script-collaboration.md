# Tests

Open 2 different browsers, login as different users

1. Add/Rename Collaborators
As the script owner (1st account), add the other account as a collaborator from the share menu. Also try renaming the script. Check the results in the other account, and check to see if a refresh is needed for the updates to take place. 

2. Remove/Delete
Try to remove the collaborator from the owner's browser. Additionally, try and delete the shared script from the collaborator's script list. Again check how these are updated on the other users' side and note any changes that need a refresh or do not work. 

3. Collaborator Bubbles/Status
Check the status of the bubbles indicating users on the script. Have both users check when originally added, refreshing, signing in, closing and reopening the script, etc. 

4. Cursor Position
Attempt moving the cursor and check for its position changing on the other browser. Try highlighting multiple selections and overlapping cursors.

5. Editing
Add text from one user, and then the other. Confirm changes are accuractly reflected, and see if the cursor behaves differently than the last test. 

6. Conflicts
Try to edit the same region at the same time as the other browser. See that the conflicts are presented consistently over time. Check both edits to the same line and same position within a line. 

7. Log Out
Try logging out from both users. Make sure status is represented correctly in the bubbles. Also make sure the shared script is not available once logged out.

8. Manual Save
Save script versions by CMD+S (CTRL+S) or compiling as the owner. See if you can revert the script to a previous version.


9. Extended Time
Stay in the collaborative session for about 5 minutes. Make sure collaborative editing continues to work, and note if any "synchronization errors" appear.


10. General Notifications
Note the behaviors of notifications throughout the process. Document if any are inconsistent, do not appear, or do not appear as intented.
